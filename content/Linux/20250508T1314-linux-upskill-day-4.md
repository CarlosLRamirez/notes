## Installing packages in Ubuntu Linux

- Think of packages like programs or applications (apps) that you install on your phone.
- Like the "App Store" or the "Market" on your phone, in Linux we call them **Package Managers**.
- One of the most popular (if not the most used) package managers in Ubuntu (and other Linux distributions based on Debian) is **apt**. 
- APT stands for "Advanced Package Tool" and is used to install, update, and manage software packages.  
- For example, to install a package, you can use the command:  
	```bash
	sudo apt install <package-name>
	```
- To update the list of available packages and their versions, run:  
	```bash
	sudo apt update
	```
- And to upgrade all installed packages to their latest versions:  
	```bash
	sudo apt upgrade
	```

---

- If you know a keyword or part of the description of a package, you can search for it using the `apt search` command. For example:  

```bash
apt search "midnight commander"
```

- This will display a list of packages matching the search term along with a brief description of each:

```bash
mc/noble-updates,now 3:4.8.30-1ubuntu0.1 arm64 [installed]
  Midnight Commander - a powerful file manager
```

- Here we can see `mc` is the **package name** for the [Midnight Commander](https://midnight-commander.org/) package (application).
- To install the package with **apt** you need to use `sudo`, unless you're already logged in as `root`.
```bash
sudo apt install mc
```

---

- Package managers like **apt** make it easy to handle dependencies and ensure your system stays up-to-date.
- There are other package managers available for Debian-based Linux distributions.
- For Red Hat-based Linux distributions, the equivalent of `apt` is `yum`. (but that's a completely different story! 🙂)

---

Now that we've installed Midnight Commander, we can use its retro interface to easily navigate the Linux file system.

## The Linux File System

- The Linux operating system has a standard file system structure. At first, it might seem a bit intimidating—especially if you're only familiar with Windows, where you have the C: drive, D: drive, and various folders within each. **With Linux, it's a totally different beast.**
- The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) defines the structure of file systems on Linux and other UNIX-like operating systems. However, Linux file systems also contain some directories that aren't yet defined by the standard.
- If you want to read the official manual of the file system hierarchy, type `man hier`

### `/` --> (La Raiz 🫚) The Root Directory 
- Everything on your Linux system is located under the `/` directory, also called the *root* directory. (Don't confuse it with the `/root` directory.)
- In Linux you don't have drive letters like C: or D:. **Everything** is under `/`, even if you have different physical drives and partitions— all of them will be under `/`.

---

### `/boot` --> 🥾 Boot files 
- Contains all the files needed to boot the system, including the currently installed Linux kernels and their supporting files.
- The GRUB bootloader’s files are stored here as well.
- It is better not to mess with this directory!

---

### `/etc` --> ⚙️ Configuration Files
- Key configuration files are stored here, and in subdirectories inside.
- Most of the files here are simple text files.
- Some interesting files under `/etc`:
	- `/etc/passwd`: contains basic information about each user account (like username, UID, default shell, etc.). Passwords are stored in another file.
	- `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`: this is the configuration file for the SSH daemon (`sshd`), which acts as the *server* for the SSH connection. (The *client* is on your computer! 💻)

---

### `/home`  -->  🏠 User Home Folders
- Each user in the system will have a folder inside `/home` (for example `/home/carlos`, `/home/ubuntu`).
- Inside each folder we have user data files, user-specific configuration files, and folders. Many of them are hidden (use `ls -la` to list them).
- Each user can only write in their own home folder.
- Example files and folders found in a home folder: `.bashrc`, `.profile`, `.ssh/`, `.config`

---

### `/root`  -->  ⛪ The root home directory  
- Instead of being inside `/home`, the root user has their own home directory in `/root`.

---

### `/bin` --> Essential binaries 🧱
- The `/bin` directory contains all the essential **system binaries** that Linux needs to function — even when it boots into a special recovery state called **single-user mode** (you can think of it like Safe Mode in Windows).
- It contains important core command-line tools that must be available even if no other filesystems are mounted yet — such as `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, and the `bash` shell.
- It traditionally has two sibling directories: `/sbin` (for essential system binaries for administrators) and `/usr/bin` (for general user binaries that are not critical for boot).

---

### `/sbin`  --> System administration binaries 💾
- The `/sbin` directory contains **essential system administration binaries** used for system booting, repairing, or managing services — like `fsck`, `reboot`, and `ifconfig`.
- These tools are generally intended for **the root user or administrators**, and may not be in a regular user’s `$PATH`.

---

### `/usr` --> 🧰 user-space programs and tools
- It contains applications and files used by users, as opposed to the system itself.
- These files and folders are meant to be read-only for regular users, unless you’re installing something manually into `/usr/local`.
- These files are installed and managed by the package manager (apt, dnf, yum, etc.).
- In some distros (especially immutable or container-focused ones like Fedora Silverblue, Alpine, or embedded systems), `/usr` is even mounted read-only at the filesystem level to improve security and stability.
- `/usr/bin`, `/usr/lib`, `/usr/share`, and `/usr/local` are examples of directories inside `/usr`.

---

### `/usr/bin` --> 🛠️ main executables for users and apps
- The `/usr/bin` directory contains **most user-level commands and applications** that are not essential for booting or single-user mode.
- It’s often much larger than `/bin` and includes tools like `git`, `nano`, `python`, `gcc`, etc.

> [!NOTE]
> ⚠️ Modern Linux systems often merge `/bin` and `/usr/bin` using symbolic links.
> So the physical separation may no longer exist — but conceptually, this is still true.

---

### `/usr/lib` --> 📚 shared libraries for installed programs
- Contains the libraries for the non-essential user-level binaries located in `/usr/bin`.

---

### `/usr/local` --> 🧪 custom software installed manually
- Locally compiled programs not managed by the package manager.

---

### `/var` --> 📝 logs and variables
- `/var` stands for "variable" — it contains files that **change frequently**, like logs and temporary data.
- It is the writable counterpart to the `/usr` directory, which must be read-only in normal operation.
- It stores **system logs**, like authentication attempts and errors, usually inside `/var/log`.
- It also holds **spools** and **queues** — like for **print jobs**, **mail**, or **cron jobs**.
- If a system is acting weird or you're running out of disk space, `/var` is often the **first place to check**.

---

### `/var/log` --> 📂 system and service logs
- This is the folder where Linux keeps **log files** from the system and various services.  
- Most of the files here are simple text files.
- Some interesting files under `/var/log` are:
	- `/var/log/auth.log`: Captures all **authentication events** — like login attempts, sudo usage, and SSH access.
	- `/var/log/syslog`: General **system activity log**, useful for debugging services and applications.
	- `/var/log/kern.log`: Messages from the **Linux kernel**, helpful when troubleshooting hardware or low-level issues.
	- `/var/log/dpkg.log`: Logs of all **package installations and updates** (on Debian/Ubuntu systems).
	- `/var/log/boot.log`: Records **messages during the system boot process**, helpful for startup issues.

---

### `/tmp` --> 🧊 temporary files for programs  
- `/tmp` is used to store **temporary files** created by programs, scripts, or the system itself.  
- The data here is **not meant to be permanent** — it's usually deleted on **reboot** or after a certain time.  
- Applications use it for things like **installers, locks, or temp caches** while they run.  
- You can manually delete files here to free up space, but be careful **not to remove in-use files**.

---

### `/dev` --> 🔌 devices as files  
- `/dev` contains **device files** that represent your hardware (like disks, USBs, and terminals).  
- Linux treats devices like files, so you can interact with them via commands (e.g., `/dev/sda`, `/dev/null`).  
- It includes both **physical devices** and **virtual ones** (like `/dev/random`, `/dev/tty`).  
- Device files are managed by the **udev** system and updated automatically as devices are added or removed.

---

### `/proc` --> 🧠 system and process info  
- `/proc` is a **virtual filesystem** that shows **real-time information** about running processes and the kernel. Similarly to `/dev`, it doesn't contain regular files but virtual representations of system internals.
- Each process has a folder like `/proc/1234` containing its memory, open files, and status.  
- It includes files like `/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/meminfo`, and `/proc/uptime` — great for monitoring.  
- These files aren't stored on disk — they’re generated live by the **kernel** when you access them.

---

### `/sys` --> 🛠️ kernel interface to hardware  
- `/sys` is another **virtual filesystem**, used to expose and control **kernel data structures**.  
- It provides detailed info about **hardware devices, drivers, and kernel modules**.  
- It’s commonly used by tools like `udevadm`, `systemd`, or `udev` to **detect and manage hardware**.  
- You can even tweak some kernel parameters from here (with caution), usually under `/sys/class` or `/sys/block`.

---

### `/lib` --> 📚 Essential common libraries 
- This folder contains libraries needed by the binaries found in `/bin` and `/sbin`.
- Linux libraries are shared collections of precompiled code that programs can use to perform common tasks.

---

### `/media` & `/mnt` --> 💽 mount points for external and manual storage  
- Both `/media` and `/mnt` are used as **mount points** — places where external or additional filesystems are attached to the main system.  
- `/media` is typically used by the **desktop environment or automount system** to mount USB drives, SD cards, and external disks automatically (e.g. `/media/carlos/USB`).  
- `/mnt` is usually reserved for **manual or temporary mounts** done by system administrators (e.g. mounting a backup disk or ISO).  
- You can mount a filesystem to either, but by convention: **automated → `/media`**, **manual → `/mnt`**.
